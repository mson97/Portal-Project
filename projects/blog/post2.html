					<h2>HTML History</h2>
					<img class="image" src="https://codyhouse.co/assets/img/gems/hero/vertical-timeline-featured.svg" alt="timeline">
					<p>Sir Tim Berners-Lee created HTML 1991. However, HTML was not officially released later in 1993.
						The next version of HTML was dubbed HTML 2.0 and was released in 1995. The next major version of HTML was published in 1999 as HTML 4.01.

						He is currently 64 years old and is the direct of W3C, the web standards organization.

						HTML goes through many changes constantly and evolved with each update.
						Along with standards and specifications, each version makes the creation of webpages easier.
						Webpages also improve in look and efficiency.

						HTML 1.0, the first version, was released in 1993. The purpose of HTML 1.0 was to share information
						in a readable, accessible format. This information would be read and accessed by web browsers.
						However, there were few developers that took part in creating websites so the HTML language did not grow.
						HTML 2.0 followed in 1995 and had all the features of HTML 1.0 and more.
						HTML 2.0 became the standard markup language for designing and creating webpages until 1997.

						Dave Ragget is an English computer specialist who is also part of the W3 Consortium and worked on many
						key web protocols such as HTML, HTTP, and voiceXML.

					<p>
						The third release of HTML, HTML 3.0, was created by Dave Raggett. Dave Raggett introduced a new draft on HTML.
						It included improved practiced of HTML that would provide more powerful characteristics for those who were designing web pages.
						However, the increase in power led to slower browsers.

					<p>
						HTML5 is considered as an extension of HTML 4.01 and was released in 2012. One key difference between 5.0 and 4.01
						is the change in page structure. In HTML 4.01, there were many classes and ID's, meaning that most tags were simply
						div tags. In HTML 5.0, the tags themselves carry meaning that pertain to each section.
